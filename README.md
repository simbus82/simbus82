### "Building" the web since 2005

#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Simone and I'm a specialist in creation and optimization of _Enterprise, Brand, SMB E-Commerce and Lead Generation_ Websites.

Thanks to a long expertise about _digital channels_ and thanks to my knownledge about many _marketing tools_, I want to put in every project the best **"SEO / CRO / UX" strategies** to improve the **performance** (Leads & Sales & Brand Authority) of every business.

My daily bread are "**data & contents**", that i can use to process the best solutions for every web ecosystem.

### Specialties:
- Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
- Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)
- Web Marketing
- User Experience
- Social Media Marketing
- Joomla! Web Engineering

I have a top-notch knowledge about "**Joomla! CMS**" since 2005 and thus i'm a "[Joomla! 3.x Certified Administrator](https://certification.joomla.org/certified-user-directory/simone-bussoni)" since 2016.

I have fully experienced the transformation of the web and digital tools, both as a user and as a supplier.

For this reason I am able to combine the "cold" analysis with the emotional aspects of "clients" and the behavioral characteristics of the "audience", allowing me to refine actions to be taken to obtain results.
